== General

This repository contains the Spatial Web Foundation's introduction document:

* SWF 0:2024 (1.0.0) - Introduction to Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture & Governance

This document serves as an introduction to The Spatial Web Protocol,
Architecture and Governance specification, version D3.1, which defines
requirements for the interoperability and governance of cyber-physical systems
at a global scale, including autonomous devices, applications, spatial content,
and operations.

The Spatial Web merges the physical and virtual worlds, transcending geographic
and national boundaries to create a global commons for expression and
imagination. This convergence, enabled by decentralizing technologies,
artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, robots, and the Internet of
Things, heralds a new era of interconnectedness.

== Building the document

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -w /metanorma -it metanorma/mn metanorma site generate
----
