== Spatial Web development

The Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance specification defines a reference model
for development of the Spatial Web. The specification was based in-part on early prototypes of
HSML, HSTP and Spatial Web nodes. This iterative and coordinated development of
specifications and implementations will continue for increasing maturity of the Spatial Web.

Development has begun of SWF Implementation Specifications for HSML, HSTP , UDG, and AIS
Rating System. Development of Spatial Web Governance and Domain-specific Architectures will
quickly follow. SWF Implementation Specifications provide suï¬ƒcient detail to allow a developer to
implement the specification and verify compliance to the specification. SWF Implementation
Specifications fulfill requirements listed in the Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance
specification. SWF Implementation Specifications will be developed in unison with
implementation of Spatial Web nodes.

The Spatial Web Foundation fosters implementation to increase the functionality of the emerging
Spatial Web. SWF interoperability sprints are key to synchronization of independent code
developments with development of the implementation specifications. Running code is essential
evidence that the specifications are ready for adoption as consensus standards. Sprints will
initially focus on simple use cases. Subsequent sprints will implement and test incrementally
more complex use cases. The early sprints provide the foundation for later sprints demonstrating
the application scenarios listed in the Stakeholder viewpoint discussed above. As the capability
and complexity continues to grow, Domain-specific architectures will emerge and will be
managed by Spatial Web domain working groups.

Development of the Spatial Web based on the Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance
specification will lead to the transformations identified by Rene and Mapes: The Spatial Web will
connect humans, machines and AI to transform the World.
