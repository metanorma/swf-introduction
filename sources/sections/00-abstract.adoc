== The Spatial Web

The Spatial Web merges the physical and virtual worlds, transcending geographic
and national boundaries to create a global commons for expression and
imagination. This convergence, enabled by decentralizing technologies,
artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, robots, and the Internet of
Things, heralds a new era of interconnectedness. The Spatial Web is built on the
foundations of the Internet. The Spatial Web, including the Hyperspatial
Modeling Language (HSML) and the Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol (HSTP),
creates a seamless digital-physical reality, leveraging augmented and virtual
reality and integrating shared values such as privacy, data ownership, and
autonomy by design. The Spatial Web is an ecosystem of interoperable, autonomous
AI agents based on open standards including HSML and HSTP.

This document is an introduction to The Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and
Governance specification, version D3.1, which defines requirements for the
interoperability and governance of cyber-physical systems at a global scale,
including autonomous devices, applications, spatial content, and operations. The
full specification is developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and the IEEE P2874
Spatial Web, Architecture and Governance Working Group.

In order to highlight foundational concepts of the Spatial Web — ENTITY,
ACTIVITY, AGENT, CONTRACT, CHANNEL, CREDENTIAL, DOMAIN, HYPERSPACE, and TIME—
are represented in this document using uppercase.
