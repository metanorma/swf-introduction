== Spatial Web concept

The Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance specification defines the
Spatial Web system design by specifying requirements for interoperability and
governance of cyber-physical systems at global scale, including autonomous
devices, applications, spatial content and operations. Networked communications
systems constructed to meet these requirements enable representation of all
statements and interactions of the physically oriented, socially-constructed
world to be universally represented in a way that makes them amenable to
computational modeling and, where applicable, simulation and automation.

The system design includes:

* a shared and linkable knowledge domain architecture (“Architecture”),
* a common language with which to describe domain elements and their interrelationships,
* a method for querying and updating the states of those elements (“Protocol”), and
* the ability to allow access and control of that method (“Governance”).

Collectively these elements are the Spatial Web Standards.

The present specification is comprehensive, encompassing an entire, emerging ecosystem and
reflecting trends and needs that drive its development, including but not limited to:

* the increasingly graph-like nature of global data,
* the opportunity autonomic activities using context-aware, cognitive AI,
* the need for composable systems and applications including the governance of such
systems,
* the intrinsic need for secure transactions,
* the rise of machine learning and neural network computation and edge computing,
* the need for explainable AI and robotic governance, and
* the rise of Digital Twins, IoT and sensor meshes.

For further background on these emerging ecosystems and trends, see The Spatial Web [B114].

The Spatial Web is a socio-technical system of systems. The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of
Autonomous and Intelligent Systems [B118] identifies the need for early incorporation of
socio-technical standards as crucial for aligning AIS with human values, intentions, and
understanding, and for reducing the risk of behaviors understood by stakeholders to be
undesirable. As a socio-technical standard, the provisions of the specification define a Spatial
Web governance framework.

The Spatial Web specification provides a reference model composed of three viewpoints: 1) Value
for stakeholders, 2) Knowledge model, and 3) Distributed computing. The viewpoints include
requirements on components of the Spatial Web system. The concepts and requirements of the
reference model guide subsequent development of Spatial Web Implementation standards and
domain-specific Spatial Web architectures.

The Spatial Web specification applies an architectural design approach to the Spatial Web
System (Figure 1). Requirements are identified by examining stakeholder perspectives and
application scenarios. As a result of design synthesis, architecture components are identified as:

● Hyperspatial Modeling Language (HSML),
● Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol (HSTP),
● Universal Domain Graph (UDG),
● Spatial Web Governance,
● Domain-specific Architectures, and
● Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) Rating System.

Requirements listed in various clauses of the Spatial Web Specification are assigned to the
architectural components, e.g., HSML, HSTP , etc. A summary of requirements for each
component is provided in an Annex of the Standard.
