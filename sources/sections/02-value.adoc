Figure 2 shows an example scenario diagram for the Warehouse robot scenario. The scenario
involves an employee and a robot working together to retrieve a book from an automated
warehouse bin and packing it for shipping. The steps in the scenario include Spatial Web Entities
in all caps. Each step in the scenario is implemented by a Distributed computing use case.

Figure 3 shows the scenario of applying Urban Digital Twin (UDTs) to Smart Cities. This scenario
shows how the Spatial Web provides interoperability of UDTs and AI agents to address urban
sustainability with a focus on energy. Energy system modeling informs action plans developed in
the Spatial Web multi-scale cognitive computing ecosystem to benefit next generation cities. The
Digital Twin Domains in this scenario - both geographic and energy grid UDTs - are detailed in
Domains and identities clause of the full specification. Each step in the scenario is implemented
by a Distributed computing use case.
