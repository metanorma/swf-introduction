== Knowledge model

A knowledge model is an abstract description of a system using concepts and ideas. The model
represents the conceptual entities that define the system and the relationships between the
entities. Figure 4 provides an overview of the Knowledge Model as described in the following
clauses.

=== Space, time, and hyperspace

The term 'hyperspace' is used to capture a generalized concept of space, in an acknowledgment
that not only do Euclidean and geographic spaces have spatial structure, but also many other,
more abstract data types. These spaces and types can be combined to form complex spaces that
can be navigated. The concept of hyperspace is derived from category theory, from which it
inherits its compositionality, and is fundamental for the Spatial Web. Figure 5 provides a summary
of the various classes of hyperspace.

== Domains and identities

Typical types of Spatial Web Domains are shown in Table 3. Domains may encompass more than
one type. Domains may exist for variable lengths of time. In addition to permissions, Domains
include information about each entity's temporality and roles, functions assumed, or parts played
by the entity or thing in a particular place and time, and information regarding the provenance and
material composition of the entity.

|===

Every Spatial Web entity, including Domains, shall include a Spatial Web Identifier (SWID) using
W3C did-core. Spatial Web entities are registered and linked in the Universal Domain Graph (UDG).
The Spatial Web provides a registration capability as a system of distributed, decentralized
registries. The Spatial Web Foundation, on behalf of the public, shall be the Registration Authority
governing general rules for changes to the UDG, such as Domain Authority, allowable Domain
names, Domain claim dispute resolution, cost of registration, and restrictions on the addition or
deletion of names.

There shall be a Domain Authority for every Spatial Web Domain. The Domain Authority shall be
an entity that is credentialed to define within a Domain the norms and terms under which
contracts are created for: agents, actions and credentials within that Domain.

Spatial Web Domains can be geopolitical (e.g., Earth, countries), authority-driven (e.g., BigCo,
SpatialWebFoundation) or IP work-related (e.g., ArthurianWorld). A given Spatial Web Domain
identifier can have multiple associated qualified names. Authoritative credentialed domains can
be issued with unique relationships defined in SPACEs (.Earth).

The Spatial Web enables the capability for all human persons to receive without cost an
irrevocable and non-transferable individual Spatial Web Domain, with respect to which that
individual will, upon acceptance, be registered as a Domain Authority at no cost (where the
exercise of such authority may be subject to limits imposed by relationships to other authorities,
e.g. citizenship).

The Spatial Web shall be a Global Commons network of networks; a portion of spaces registered
in the UDG shall be gateways to private networks managed by network administrators. The UDG
shall be a publicly accessible knowledge graph that serves as a key infrastructure component of
the Spatial Web. The UDG shall be similar to existing knowledge bases held within current web
platforms but shall be a public utility compared to proprietary platform knowledge. The UDG is a
hypergraph containing relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web. The UDG is
composed of nodes and links where the nodes are ENTITIES, and the links are relations between
the ENTITIES. Figure 6 shows a notional visualization of the UDG with varying cluster patterns of
the nodes. Based on current large knowledge graphs and a DGGS of the Earth where every cell is
a decimeter-scale node, the global UDG contains approximately 1014 nodes.

=== Agents and activities

==== Spatial Web Agents

An Agent is a Domain that senses and responds to its environment, maintains a
model of its environment, and takes actions to achieve its goals (Figure 7). An
Agent type of Domain is characterized by its capacity for agency. It engages in
Activities, which are actions aimed at effecting changes in its environment
(from ISO/IEC 22989). An Agent may include natural intelligence or artificial
intelligence.

.Agent-based paradigm
image::figure-07.png[]

Agents can be both digital, such as software applications or AI systems, and cyber-physical, like
robots or autonomous vehicles. Their core functionalities include sensing and perceiving the
environment, which are vital for gathering data, formulating plans, and making informed decisions
to execute goal-directed actions. Physical or digital actuation capabilities enable Agents to
implement changes within their environment and interact with other Entities, including other IoT
devices, services, digital interfaces, and other Agents. Their functionality extends to simulating
real-world scenarios, modeling spatial interactions, manipulating virtual or physical constructs,
and facilitating user interactions by providing guidance, information, or immersive experiences.

Agents exhibit a spectrum of behaviors that reflect their varying levels of intelligence, from simple
reactive response to complex, goal-oriented actions and sophisticated social interactions. The
capacity for enacting autonomous, goal-oriented behavior underpins the functionality,
interoperability, adaptability, and realization of shared intelligence within the Spatial Web (Friston,
et.al. [B22]). The Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) Rating System provides a standardized
mechanism for evaluating and identifying the various capabilities of autonomous intelligent
Agents. This system establishes a flexible and structured framework, enabling developers,
policymakers, and other agents to effectively identify, interact with, and manage agent activities,
serving as a key component of the Spatial Web governance framework.

==== HSML Activities

HSML Activities refer to the actions or sets of actions performed by Agents. Activities can range
from simple tasks like retrieving information or updating a status, to complex operations involving
multiple steps, decisions, and interactions with other Agents. Activities are essential for
representing and translating Agents' objectives into concrete actions, facilitating their interaction
with the environment, and coordination with other Agents. The HSML framework supports this
relationship by offering a unified language and protocols for defining, instantiating, executing, and
monitoring Agent Activities. This standardization is crucial for ensuring interoperability among
diverse systems and Agents, ensuring that Agents can interact with and understand each other,
as well as with the digital and physical environments they operate in.

== Credentials, norms, and contracts
A Credential is a set of one or more claims made by a Domain. A Norm is a standard or principle
of right action serving to guide, control, or regulate proper and acceptable behavior, which can be
specified in terms of the conditions under which it is binding on agents’ actions and the
conditions under which such actions conform or fail to conform to it. A Contract is a binding
agreement between two parties, especially enforceable by law, or a similar internal agreement
wholly within an organization.

HSML Activities, as described in the previous clause, represent possible actions on the part of
Agents operating on the Spatial Web, and are defined in terms of the conditions they aim to bring
about, specified in terms of HSML data structures. Activity conditions can, for example, be
represented as a query run against the HSML representation of a Domain, which evaluates to a
Boolean indicating whether or not the Activity’s defining conditions have been satisfied in the
Domain model.

The execution of Spatial Web Activities within Domain(s) may also be subject to conditions
imposed unilaterally, mutually agreed upon or negotiated between parties to a transaction.
Examples include provisions in a contract for work or transfer of ownership, as well as Domain
rules that actors within a Domain explicitly or implicitly agree to abide by, including laws and
regulations issued by various authorities. These conditions can similarly be represented as
expressions evaluable against the state of HSML Domain models.

HSML Contracts and Activities encode expectations about how certain entities will behave,
conditional on specific assumptions encoded as Activity conditions (predicates). Activities
encoding a machine-readable description of normative constraints on Agent behavior in an
Activity’s initial conditions and the consequences of conforming to or violating the rule in its
resulting conditions can represent rules or other normative structures. Agents operating in a
governed Domain may then assent to this form of governance by explicitly signing a Contract to
participate in the enforcement Activity, or Domain-specific sub-types of Activities may be created
based on such normative constraints, as described above. Where these constraints are applied,
governance of Activities within relevant Domains is accomplished by granting Credentials for only
those Activity types found consistent with Domain Authority rules.

Activities occurring within a Domain are subject to rules (more broadly, norms) enforced by
relevant Domain Authorities, but this entails nothing about the legitimacy, in absolute terms, of
the rules specified by such Authorities, or their claimed right to impose or enforce them. In
particular, the authority of a Domain Authority over any Domain is limited by factors such as the
existence of higher-level Domain Authorities in a Domain hierarchy, and by the self-sovereignty of
some Domains, such as those representing individual human beings.

The Spatial Web Foundation takes no position on which norms enforced by Domain Authorities
are binding on any given individual, organization, nation, etc., but allows participants in the Spatial
Web to represent their normative claims by way of rules associated with credentialed Domain
Authorities, as well as via Contracts. Some Domain Authorities in the Spatial Web will mirror
relevant authorities in the real world (e.g. sovereign nations, which, like sovereign human
individuals, have the right to control over the Spatial Web Domains representing their territories).
The infrastructure of the Spatial Web is not designed to settle conflicts among Domain
Authorities, but to represent such conflicts accurately in the form of competing claims, each with
its provenance. Participation in a Domain (via the execution of Activities by a Spatial Web agent)
may involve explicit consent to the terms governing that Domain, via HSML Contract.

=== Spatial Web ontology

The Spatial Web ontology is composed of Entities that are the primary concepts used across the
Spatial Web and in HSML. HSML implements the Spatial Web ontology as a set of schemas that
enable increased coherence across diverse datasets without sacrificing flexibility.
The Spatial Web ontology Figure 8 defines several classes. All classes are types of the Entity base
class. The Spatial Web ontology builds upon several existing ontologies, i.e., IEEE 7007-2021
[B40], ISO/IEC 21838-1:2021 [B55], Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). Available at:
[B117], and Pease [B113].

Figure 9 depicts the core relationships that are obtained in the HSML ontology among (a)
AGENTs, (b) ACTIVITY Schemas, (c) ACTIVITIES (aka ACTIVITY Instances), (d) CONTRACTS. A
Requester is an AGENT requesting the performance of a task or other CONTRACT. The loop
connection on ACTIVITY Schema represents the composition of Complex ACTIVITY Schemas.

=== Queries

Queries on the Spatial Web are expressed using HSML and are used to identify information about
DOMAINS in the Universal Domain Graph. HSML enables a variety of query types, including but
not limited to:

* Bootstrapping/Context queries
* Activity queries
* Hyperspace range queries
* Abstract data type query
* Graph queries
* Semantic queries
* Vector queries
